# Toman Bikeshare Dashboard Analysis

## Problem Statement 

Toman Bikeshare seeks to determine whether increasing subscription prices for the upcoming year without causing a significant loss in customer base is feasible. The company requires a dashboard that provides key performance indicators (KPIs) to analyze revenue, profitability trends, seasonal variations, and rider demographics to aid in this decision. 

## Findings 
### Hourly revenue analysis 
The dashboard highlights hourly revenue data, revealing the most profitable hours occur during midday and early evening (10:00 to 15:00). Days like Wednesday and Friday also show notably higher sales, indicating variable profitability across the week. These insights can guide operational adjustments to maximize revenue during peak hours.

### Profit and revenue trends 
Over a two-year period (2021-2022), the sum of revenue reached $15 million, while profits totaled $10.45 million, with a consistent profit margin of 45%. Monthly revenue trends show a seasonal spike during the summer months.

### Seasonal revenue analysis 
Seasonal data analysis indicates that Quarter 3 (summer) is the most profitable, contributing $4.9 million in revenue. In contrast, Quarter 1 (winter) shows the lowest revenue at $2.2 million. This finding underscores the importance of tailoring strategies to seasonal fluctuations.

### Rider demographics
The majority of riders (81.17%) are registered users, while 18.83% are casual riders. This segmentation suggests a strong reliance on subscription-based income, emphasizing the need to evaluate the potential impact of a price increase on this core customer group.

## Recommendations

### Conservative price increase 
Given the strong profit margin and significant reliance on registered users, a conservative price increase of 10-15% is recommended:

- A 10% increase would raise the price from $4.99 to $5.49.

- A 15% increase would set the price at approximately $5.74.
This range is suggested to test the market's response without risking substantial customer attrition.

### Market analysis  
Conduct further market research to understand customer satisfaction, potential competitive changes, and the overall economic environment. 
 
### Pricing strategy 
Consider differentiated pricing for casual versus registered users to account for varying price sensitivities.

### Monitor and adjust 
Implement new pricing with ongoing monitoring of customer feedback and sales data to refine the strategy and prevent overpricing.

## Conclusion 
The dashboard provides comprehensive insights into Toman Bikeshare's financial performance, rider behavior, and seasonal trends. A conservative price increase of 10-15% appears viable based on the findings. Implementing a segmented pricing strategy and conducting market research will further ensure the company maintains its customer base while optimizing profitability.
